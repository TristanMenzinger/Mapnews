I couldn’t do it. Something about it felt a little too exploitative for me. I never felt OK when I was watching it. Maybe that’s the main thing.

They exist as creatures who act on a range of terrible decisions. It doesn’t do for them to be seen floating around in the nebulous, dreamy world of literature, with its nuances and its conflicting ideas. But all photo opportunities are good photo opportunities when you’re running for office, and I had every confidence that New Zealand’s political leaders would say yes when I approached them this year to pose beside their bookcases.</p><p>It was for the series of photographs I run every Friday to illustrate the weekly best-seller chart at Newsroom, where I serve as books editor. For quite a long time I asked authors and various other literary types to send in photographs of their bookcases. Most of the photos appeared without any response. They were kind of interesting at the same time as being kind of really boring. Eventually I realised it might be a better idea to ask the authors to be in the photographs as well, and I extended the idea to invite political leaders in 2020 as an election year carrot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/photos-of-new-zealand-politicians-and-their-bookcases-are-creepily-revealing\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/photos-of-new-zealand-politicians-and-their-bookcases-are-creepily-revealing","published":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:00:23 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"New Zealand’S","count":1,"lat":-41.28949,"lng":174.77694,"type":"country"},{"name":"New Zealand","count":6,"lat":-41.28949,"lng":174.77694,"type":"country"},{"name":"Tauranga","count":2,"lat":-37.68276,"lng":176.16884,"type":"point"},{"name":"Muller","count":1,"lat":-27.10924,"lng":27.89779,"type":"point"},{"name":"Auckland","count":4,"lat":-36.85232,"lng":174.76388,"type":"point"},{"name":"Pacific","count":1,"lat":38.48359,"lng":-90.74141,"type":"point"},{"name":"Maori","count":1,"lat":31.64786,"lng":76.90999,"type":"point"},{"name":"Kerikeri","count":2,"lat":-35.22731,"lng":173.94902,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World - Europe","feed_url":"http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","title":"Benishangul-Gumuz: Attackers kill dozens in western Ethiopia","summary":"More than 100 people were killed in fires or by shooting and stabbing attacks, reports say.","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55428531","published":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 20:51:02 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Tigray","count":1,"lat":10.34021,"lng":-84.58133,"type":"point"}],"source":"BBC"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"Trump pardon of Blackwater killers sparks outrage in Iraq","summary":"<p>The pardons of four Blackwater contractors has reignited anger over one of the most disturbing episodes in the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p>","link":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-23/trump-pardons-blackwater-killers-sparking-outrage-in-iraq-and-elsewhere","published":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:35:49 -0500","geolocations":[{"name":"Baghdad","count":1,"lat":33.3421,"lng":44.39307,"type":"point"},{"name":"Blackwater","count":5,"lat":-23.58569,"lng":148.88012,"type":"point"},{"name":"U.S.","count":7,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Iraq","count":5,"lat":33.3421,"lng":44.39307,"type":"country"},{"name":"The United States","count":4,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Washington","count":3,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"point"},{"name":"Iran","count":1,"lat":35.68877,"lng":51.41503,"type":"country"},{"name":"Afghanistan","count":2,"lat":34.53313,"lng":69.10223,"type":"country"},{"name":"Amman","count":1,"lat":31.9518,"lng":35.94042,"type":"point"}],"source":"Los Angeles Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"Police Took Their Son Away.

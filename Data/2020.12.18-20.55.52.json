Reeves and hyped to the heavens, Projekt Red’s dystopian but glitchy romp has been pulled from sale. What went wrong? </p><p>Cyberpunk 2077, one of the most-anticipated video games of the year was released last week. A dystopian romp around a Blade Runner-inspired city, it had all the ingredients for a perfect storm of hype: it’s been nearly a decade in the making; its creator, Warsaw’s CD Projekt Red, was behind one of the greatest games of the last decade (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/13/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-xbox-ps4-pc\">The Witcher 3 </a>– think Game of Thrones but grimier); it stars Keanu Reeves, who is as popular with gamers as he is with everybody else. Eight million people had pre-ordered and paid for the game before it came out. But since 10 December, it’s all gone horribly wrong.</p><p>On launch day, the reviews were good – great, even. Many critics praised the fictional Night City’s realism, its striking skyscraping architecture and grubby alleys; they loved the invigorating gunplay, ballsy characters and neon swagger. Some expressed reservations about the game’s rather adolescent tone and its eagerness to objectify women’s bodies – neither of which were a surprise to anyone who’d been keeping an eye on the game’s marketing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/18/cyberpunk-2077-how-2020s-biggest-video-game-launch-turned-into-a-shambles\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/18/cyberpunk-2077-how-2020s-biggest-video-game-launch-turned-into-a-shambles","published":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:27:20 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Warsaw","count":1,"lat":52.2356,"lng":21.01037,"type":"point"},{"name":"Moscow","count":1,"lat":55.75696,"lng":37.61502,"type":"point"},{"name":"Night City","count":1,"lat":35.31131,"lng":-97.53251,"type":"point"},{"name":"Bethesda","count":1,"lat":38.98637,"lng":-77.09692,"type":"point"},{"name":"America","count":1,"lat":51.43739,"lng":5.98176,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"Fire hazards found at block housing Grenfell Tower survivors","summary":"<p>Residents shocked to find block owned by Kensington and Chelsea is ‘not fire safe’</p><p>Fire hazards similar to those found at Grenfell Tower have been discovered at a block bought by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to house survivors of the disaster that killed 72 people.</p><p>To the horror of residents, round the clock “waking watch” patrols started on Friday at Doveberry Place in north-west London after a risk assessment uncovered problems with fire protection between floors, doors and ventilation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/18/fire-hazards-found-at-block-housing-grenfell-tower-survivors\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/18/fire-hazards-found-at-block-housing-grenfell-tower-survivors","published":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:57:48 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Kensington","count":1,"lat":39.02627,"lng":-77.07507,"type":"point"},{"name":"Doveberry Place","count":2,"lat":36.37936,"lng":-94.19484,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World - Europe","feed_url":"http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","title":"Covid-19: Is rule-breaking causing the surge?","summary":"Ros Atkins from BBC's Outside Source asks if it's people or policies behind the rising infection rates.","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55356700","published":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:05:50 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Europe","count":1,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"}],"source":"BBC"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"The FDA didn't 'approve' Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.

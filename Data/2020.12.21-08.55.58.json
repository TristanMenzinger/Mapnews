In 2020, the Democratic party learned what King Pyrrhus was talking about. They recaptured the White House and narrowly held on to the House of Representatives. And if the Democrats win both Senate runoffs in Georgia, they may yet capture the Senate. But Republicans increased their share of the House, making it easier for them to recapture it in 2022, and they control a majority of state legislatures whose redistricting plans for the US Congress can help the Republican party.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest blow has been to the progressive interpretation of American politics. Most progressives have understood Trumpism as the last gasp of a dwindling, reactionary white male population. The future of the Democrats, it was said, lay with women and minorities. And yet in 2020 white men shifted more toward Biden than white women did. Black and brown Americans still voted mostly for Democrats, but there were significant shifts toward the Republicans among black and Hispanic voters and all of the Republicans who took contested seats from the Democrats were minority group members or women.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal","published":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 11:21:47 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"Your Monday Briefing","summary":"The coronavirus is mutating.","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/briefing/virus-mutation-uk-china-censorship-muppets.html","published":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 19:57:41 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","count":2,"lat":38.95953,"lng":-91.92768,"type":"point"},{"name":"The United Kingdom","count":1,"lat":38.95953,"lng":-91.92768,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":2,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"},{"name":"England","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"country"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"The most important company you've never heard of is being dragged into the U.S.-China rivalry","summary":"<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. makes chips for iPhones, video game consoles and fighter jets.

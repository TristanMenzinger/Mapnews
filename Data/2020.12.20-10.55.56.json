Combining the colourful charm and romance of Richard Donner’s 1978 <em>Superman</em> with an empowering 21st-century gender-flipped sensibility, it shifts the action from the battlegrounds of the first world war to the bumbags and rolled-up sleeves of the US in the 80s. The result is an entertaining (if somewhat overlong) adventure that once again owes more to the fun-loving spirit of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em> than to the dour DC drudgery of <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice </em>or <em>Justice League</em>.</p><p>As WW Jacobs’s tale <em>The Monkey’s Paw</em> tells us, wishes <em>can</em> come true – but at a terrible price. When a mysterious ancient stone turns up at the Smithsonian workplace of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), its powers are initially hidden. But when self-conscious, socially awkward gemologist Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) dreams of being more like her new friend Diana (strong, cool, beautiful), her imaginary makeover somehow becomes a reality.

And if the Democrats win both Senate runoffs in Georgia, they may yet capture the Senate. But Republicans increased their share of the House, making it easier for them to recapture it in 2022, and they control a majority of state legislatures whose redistricting plans for the US Congress can help the Republican party.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest blow has been to the progressive interpretation of American politics.

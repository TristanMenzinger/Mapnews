But one person whose act of scientific generosity ought to be remembered is <a href=\"https://time.com/5882918/zhang-yongzhen-interview-china-coronavirus-genome/\" title=\"\">Zhang Yongzhen</a>. The scientist, who works out of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, was the first to map the whole genome sequence of Sars-CoV-2. He did so on 5 January 2020 and hoped to share it with researchers by uploading his work to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).</p><p>The professor knew he was dealing with a deadly virus – but he had no idea how dangerous. The pathogen has killed more than 1.7 million people and shut down nations, leaving a trail of economic disruption. Concerned that the NCBI would take its time, the scientist sanctioned the sequence’s <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/g-cdh111020.php\" title=\"\">global public release</a> via an Australian colleague. On 11 January, when Wuhan recorded its first Covid death, the virus’s genomic sequence was posted on an <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/chinese-researchers-reveal-draft-genome-virus-implicated-wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak\" title=\"\">open access site</a>.

When it was clear that the Conservatives would achieve a majority on the bill, Keir Starmer should have given a speech setting out the pros and cons of the bill (the first part should not have taken too long) and then given his MPs a free vote, with the advice to abstain. The majority would have been much smaller. And Starmer would be free to say what he liked in response to future issues. So your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-debate-no-scrutiny-no-choice\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (30 December) was wrong to say Starmer was “right to judge that Labour could not afford to be associated … with … ‘no deal’” – that was not even on the table.

A benighted government – not hard to imagine – decides to restore public hanging for petty larceny. After much debate and protest, a “listening” government proposes deportation to South Georgia instead. Right, says lawyerly Sir Keir, deportation is better than hanging, so we’ll support the South Georgia option as the lesser of two evils. That way we can “look to the future” and recoup the law-and-order vote. Wrong: you will have abdicated responsibility, abandoned principle, and alienated progressive voters. And you will have walked into another obvious Tory trap. So much for “under new management”.<br /><strong>Alan Knight</strong><br /><em>St Antony’s College, Oxford</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/31/labours-mistake-in-backing-the-brexit-bill\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/31/labours-mistake-in-backing-the-brexit-bill","published":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:23:28 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"East Riding","count":1,"lat":36.48058,"lng":-94.20582,"type":"point"},{"name":"Yorkshire","count":1,"lat":42.53022,"lng":-78.47608,"type":"point"},{"name":"South Georgia","count":1,"lat":31.58606,"lng":-84.11348,"type":"point"},{"name":"Europe","count":2,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Ireland","count":1,"lat":53.34807,"lng":-6.24827,"type":"country"},{"name":"Scotland","count":1,"lat":55.95438,"lng":-3.20144,"type":"country"},{"name":"Peterborough","count":1,"lat":52.57346,"lng":-0.2481,"type":"point"},{"name":"Cambridgeshire","count":1,"lat":52.38033,"lng":-0.06823,"type":"point"},{"name":"Dublin","count":1,"lat":53.34807,"lng":-6.24827,"type":"point"},{"name":"Dover","count":1,"lat":39.15803,"lng":-75.52473,"type":"point"},{"name":"Canterbury","count":1,"lat":51.27598,"lng":1.0756,"type":"point"},{"name":"Kent","count":1,"lat":47.3807,"lng":-122.23741,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"Jonathan Pollard, American Who Spied for Israel, Welcomed by Netanyahu","summary":"Mr. Pollard, who gave a range of classified documents to Israel starting in 1984, recently completed his parole.

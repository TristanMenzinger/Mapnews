Smith was in her early 20s, working at a bookshop and living in the Chelsea Hotel with her then lover, the playwright Sam Shepard. She had attended poetry readings before, most of which put her into a deep sleep. “I wanted to do something that wasn’t boring,” she recalls. “Sam said that since I sang to myself all the time, I should try singing a song, or maybe do something with a guitar.” And so she called on the musician Lenny Kaye to provide “interpretative” noises on guitar while she half-read, half-sang her poems.</p><p>The show was an instant hit. “It seemed to make a big impression on people – which I really didn’t understand,” she says. The producer Sandy Pearlman approached her afterwards and suggested she front a rock band. She eventually took his advice, making the landmark album Horses in 1975, and an icon of American punk was born.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/29/patti-smith-new-year-piccadilly-circus-screens\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/29/patti-smith-new-year-piccadilly-circus-screens","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 08:00:36 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"New York’S","count":1,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"New York","count":3,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"},{"name":"Piccadilly Circus","count":1,"lat":51.5101,"lng":-0.13444,"type":"point"},{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Peaceable Kingdom","count":1,"lat":36.84261,"lng":-77.86283,"type":"point"},{"name":"Paris","count":1,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"point"},{"name":"Sweden","count":1,"lat":59.33257,"lng":18.06683,"type":"country"},{"name":"Milan","count":1,"lat":45.46796,"lng":9.18178,"type":"point"},{"name":"Cambridge","count":1,"lat":52.20992,"lng":0.11161,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"Trump pardon of Blackwater killers sparks outrage in Iraq","summary":"<p>The pardons of four Blackwater contractors has reignited anger over one of the most disturbing episodes in the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p>","link":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-23/trump-pardons-blackwater-killers-sparking-outrage-in-iraq-and-elsewhere","published":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:35:49 -0500","geolocations":[{"name":"Baghdad","count":1,"lat":33.3421,"lng":44.39307,"type":"point"},{"name":"Blackwater","count":5,"lat":-23.58569,"lng":148.88012,"type":"point"},{"name":"U.S.","count":7,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Iraq","count":5,"lat":33.3421,"lng":44.39307,"type":"country"},{"name":"The United States","count":4,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Washington","count":3,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"point"},{"name":"Iran","count":1,"lat":35.68877,"lng":51.41503,"type":"country"},{"name":"Afghanistan","count":2,"lat":34.53313,"lng":69.10223,"type":"country"},{"name":"Amman","count":1,"lat":31.9518,"lng":35.94042,"type":"point"}],"source":"Los Angeles Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"The retail industry’s tumultuous year began before the pandemic.","summary":"","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/world/the-retail-industrys-tumultuous-year-began-before-the-pandemic.html","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 15:47:40 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Walmart","count":1,"lat":23.75157,"lng":-99.15586,"type":"point"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"1 of every 17 people in the U.S. has been infected, and 1 in 1,000 has died.

Many a time, his neck has been risked and his arm has been chanced; he makes movies to challenge us. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/white-god-review-kornel-mundruczo\">White God (2014)</a> was a Hitchcockian nightmare about a mass uprising among all the dogs in a city, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/18/jupiters-moon-review-kornel-mundruczo-flying-refugee-cannes-2017\">Jupiter’s Mood (2017)</a> was a fantasy superhero-parable about a Syrian refugee who gets the ability to fly after being shot by an immigration cop.<br /><br />Most of his movies have been set in Hungary, but this new drama, scripted by Kata Wéber (who also wrote White God and Jupiter’s Moon), is his first English-language film, set in an indeterminate American city (but filmed in Quebec). It’s a vehement, forthright and sometimes unwatchably painful and upsetting emotional drama about the death of a baby; his two stars, Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf, are at all times giving it upwards of 10,000%, especially Kirby. This is clearly a personally engaged film for its creators; I wanted to admire it and in a sense I do. But there is something self-conscious and hammily plotted about it, once we have got past the real-time ordeal of its terrifying opening scene. There are times when a North American transplant of this European director is unconvincing, and the central situation itself is like a pop-art image rather than the impassioned real thing. We are uncomfortably close to Lars von Trier territory, or maybe Atom Egoyan at his most prescriptive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/29/pieces-of-a-woman-review-kornel-mundruczo-shia-labeouf-vanessa-kirby\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/29/pieces-of-a-woman-review-kornel-mundruczo-shia-labeouf-vanessa-kirby","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 12:00:42 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Jupiter","count":2,"lat":26.93277,"lng":-80.10189,"type":"point"},{"name":"Hungary","count":1,"lat":47.49972,"lng":19.05508,"type":"country"},{"name":"Quebec","count":1,"lat":46.81273,"lng":-71.2193,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"My best pandemic shot: Guardian and Observer photographers' 2020","summary":"<p>We asked our photographers to pick an image that best highlighted an aspect of the coronavirus pandemic</p><p>We asked the Guardian and Observer’s team of photographers to pick an image that represented something interesting about covering the pandemic in 2020.

He used a razor to make three incisions on the insteps of my feet, my wrists, my elbows, my forehead and on the back of my neck. As blood started to flow, the healer rubbed a concoction of herbs into the incisions and gave me a potion to drink. He took alligator pepper and rubbed it on various parts of my body. There was a rooster, into which he cast the “demon” inside me. The rooster was slaughtered and thrown into the river, supposedly taking my sexuality with it.<br /><br />In boarding school, I met a boy who I would say was my first love. We talked about everything and liked to take long walks. But he struggled. I watched him struggle to accept his sexuality. He felt there was something wrong with him but I didn’t know how to help him. For me it was different. It wasn’t just about sexuality; it was also about gender. I was born male but I have never felt like a man.<br /><br />When I was 22, in university, I met a transgender woman. She was a lot more open, more cosmopolitan, more upfront about what she wanted. I’d never met anyone like her. We had a sisterhood –– fun, graceful, pure.

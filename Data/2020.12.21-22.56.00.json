In 2020, the Democratic party learned what King Pyrrhus was talking about. They recaptured the White House and narrowly held on to the House of Representatives. And if the Democrats win both Senate runoffs in Georgia, they may yet capture the Senate. But Republicans increased their share of the House, making it easier for them to recapture it in 2022, and they control a majority of state legislatures whose redistricting plans for the US Congress can help the Republican party.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest blow has been to the progressive interpretation of American politics. Most progressives have understood Trumpism as the last gasp of a dwindling, reactionary white male population. The future of the Democrats, it was said, lay with women and minorities. And yet in 2020, white men shifted more toward Biden than white women did. Black and brown Americans still voted mostly for Democrats, but there were significant shifts toward the Republicans among black and Hispanic voters, and all of the Republicans who took contested seats from the Democrats were minority group members or women.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal","published":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 11:21:47 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml","title":"Biden receives COVID vaccine as US distributes shots","summary":"Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been largely absent from public view as he remains focused on his election loss.","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/21/biden-set-to-receive-covid-vaccine-as-us-distributes-shots","published":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 15:48:35 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Newark","count":1,"lat":53.07428,"lng":-0.80972,"type":"point"},{"name":"Delaware","count":1,"lat":39.15803,"lng":-75.52473,"type":"point"},{"name":"The United States","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Washington, Dc","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"point"}],"source":"Aljazeera"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"Covid is a chance to build a world where everyone has access to basic vaccines | David Miliband and Anuradha Gupta","summary":"<p>Preventable diseases still plague those missing out on vaccines.

But one of them caused a revolution in art. We unravel the mystery of the Magi</p><p>They came bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. This description of the Magi, the three kings or wise men who followed a star to the newborn Jesus, has always given artists plenty of scope to depict ornate boxes, cups and vessels. Paintings show them followed by pages, servants, soldiers and pack animals – an entire royal retinue. Dressed in their finest, making their way across deserts and over mountains guided by a light, these pilgrims to the lowly stable always look magnificent. </p><p>Although the<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202&amp;version=NKJV\"> Gospel of Matthew</a> does not give individual names to this regal trio, we know them as Balthasar, Caspar and Melchior, thanks to a Greek manuscript from AD500. It was in the middle ages, too, that they were promoted from astronomers to kings. And a text attributed to the Venerable Bede, the historian monk from Northumbria, <a href=\"https://msu.edu/~williss2/carpentier/part1/balthasar.html\">makes Balthasar black</a>. Despite Bede’s assertion, there are very few images of a black Balthasar before 1400, possibly because medieval Europeans had so little concept of Africans. It was only with the dawning of the Renaissance that Balthasar’s colour began to be emphatically depicted. In fact, the trumpeting, joyous festive subject of “the adoration” inspired some of the richest portrayals of black people in European art.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/21/christmas-cards-star-baby-jesus-myrrh-mystery-balthasar-three-kings-black-art\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/21/christmas-cards-star-baby-jesus-myrrh-mystery-balthasar-three-kings-black-art","published":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 11:48:22 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Northumbria","count":1,"lat":51.5099,"lng":-0.74824,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":2,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"},{"name":"Europe","count":3,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Portugal","count":1,"lat":38.72639,"lng":-9.14948,"type":"country"},{"name":"Spain","count":1,"lat":40.41955,"lng":-3.69196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Atlantic","count":2,"lat":39.36287,"lng":-74.42637,"type":"point"},{"name":"Nuremberg","count":1,"lat":49.45434,"lng":11.07349,"type":"point"},{"name":"Florence","count":1,"lat":43.78237,"lng":11.25501,"type":"point"},{"name":"Botticelli","count":1,"lat":19.38302,"lng":-99.18542,"type":"point"},{"name":"China","count":1,"lat":39.90657,"lng":116.38765,"type":"country"},{"name":"Venice","count":2,"lat":45.43811,"lng":12.31815,"type":"point"},{"name":"Antwerp","count":3,"lat":51.22212,"lng":4.39769,"type":"point"},{"name":"Hieronymus Bosch’S","count":1,"lat":52.09552,"lng":4.58555,"type":"point"},{"name":"West Africa","count":1,"lat":-25.75454,"lng":28.12443,"type":"point"},{"name":"Columbus","count":1,"lat":39.96199,"lng":-83.00275,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"A Minnesota state senator, one of several who contracted the coronavirus after local Republican meetings, has died.","summary":"","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/world/a-minnesota-state-senator-one-of-several-who-contracted-the-coronavirus-after-local-republican-meetings-has-died.html","published":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 14:55:29 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Minnesota","count":1,"lat":44.94339,"lng":-93.09648,"type":"point"},{"name":"St. Cloud","count":2,"lat":28.24966,"lng":-81.28438,"type":"point"},{"name":"Vietnam","count":1,"lat":21.02888,"lng":105.85464,"type":"country"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"She Called Police Over a Neo-Nazi Threat.

In 2020, the Democratic party learned what King Pyrrhus was talking about. They recaptured the White House and narrowly held on to the House of Representatives. And if the Democrats win both Senate runoffs in Georgia, they may yet capture the Senate. But Republicans increased their share of the House, making it easier for them to recapture it in 2022, and they control a majority of state legislatures whose redistricting plans for the US Congress can help the Republican party.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest blow has been to the progressive interpretation of American politics. Most progressives have understood Trumpism as the last gasp of a dwindling, reactionary white male population. The future of the Democrats, it was said, lay with women and minorities. And yet in 2020 white men shifted more toward Biden than white women did. Black and brown Americans still voted mostly for Democrats, but there were significant shifts toward the Republicans among black and Hispanic voters and all of the Republicans who took contested seats from the Democrats were minority group members or women.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/progressives-us-democrats-power-new-deal","published":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 11:21:47 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"What could Trump have done to produce a different election outcome?","summary":"<p>One can't help but wonder: What could Trump have done — other than his tragicomic efforts after the fact — to produce a different election outcome?</p>","link":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-12-15/what-could-trump-have-done-to-produce-a-different-election-outcome","published":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:06 -0500","geolocations":[{"name":"Arizona","count":1,"lat":33.44825,"lng":-112.0758,"type":"point"},{"name":"Wisconsin","count":1,"lat":43.07313,"lng":-89.38644,"type":"point"},{"name":"New York","count":2,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"China","count":1,"lat":39.90657,"lng":116.38765,"type":"country"},{"name":"Los Angeles","count":1,"lat":34.05357,"lng":-118.24545,"type":"point"},{"name":"N.Y.","count":2,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"Ky","count":1,"lat":19.29657,"lng":-81.38175,"type":"country"},{"name":"Gastonia","count":2,"lat":35.26221,"lng":-81.18702,"type":"point"},{"name":"N.C.","count":1,"lat":-22.24292,"lng":166.46133,"type":"country"}],"source":"Los Angeles Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"How the COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer compare head to head","summary":"<p>If the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech was good enough to get a nod from the FDA, the vaccine from Moderna and the NIH almost certainly is as well.</p>","link":"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-12-15/how-the-covid-19-vaccines-from-moderna-and-pfizer-compare-head-to-head","published":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 20:44:52 -0500","geolocations":[{"name":"California","count":1,"lat":38.57944,"lng":-121.49085,"type":"point"},{"name":"Moderna","count":1,"lat":25.69993,"lng":-100.28336,"type":"point"}],"source":"Los Angeles Times"},{"feed_name":"World - Europe","feed_url":"http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","title":"Prato: The Italian town turning rags into new clothes","summary":"A small Italian town has built its fortune on transforming the world's old scraps into new clothes.","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55267992","published":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:00:42 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Italy","count":1,"lat":41.90322,"lng":12.49565,"type":"country"}],"source":"BBC"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"Protestant Church That Found Refuge in Italy’s Hills Helps Syrians Do the Same","summary":"Mindful of a history of persecution, members of the Waldensian Church have been at the forefront of a push to bring refugees from Syria to Italy.","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/world/europe/protestant-church-that-found-refuge-in-italys-hills-helps-syrians-do-the-same.html","published":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 21:26:37 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Italy","count":1,"lat":41.90322,"lng":12.49565,"type":"country"},{"name":"Syria","count":2,"lat":33.51656,"lng":36.31708,"type":"point"},{"name":"Europe","count":1,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Mediterranean","count":1,"lat":25.04446,"lng":55.13858,"type":"point"},{"name":"Lebanon","count":1,"lat":33.89607,"lng":35.50678,"type":"country"},{"name":"Rome","count":1,"lat":41.90322,"lng":12.49565,"type":"point"},{"name":"Alpine","count":1,"lat":32.83466,"lng":-116.7525,"type":"point"},{"name":"Western Piedmont","count":1,"lat":35.97476,"lng":-83.9716,"type":"point"},{"name":"Piedmont","count":1,"lat":34.70051,"lng":-82.46735,"type":"point"},{"name":"France","count":1,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"country"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"This year was not supposed to be anything like 2019 — and COVID made sure of it","summary":"<p>In 2020, we could witness stars being born in a distant galaxy.

They climbed to the top of the bestsellers charts and were picked up by avid anti-racists and clueless Instagram influencers alike. They were also left on the shelves by those who ordered them in a blinding flash of white guilt and didn’t bother to read them. Google “black authors 2020” and you’ll get dozens of reading lists.

Instead, both these books resonated because their authors are warm storytellers with a rich interest in how and why people move through the world. These are writers full of ideas and heart, who will make you care as deeply about their characters as they do, whether a grizzled man injured up a Scottish mountain, or a scared American housewife baking a lopsided cake.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/19/jackie-kay-brit-bennett-scottish-poet-laureate-vanishing-half\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/19/jackie-kay-brit-bennett-scottish-poet-laureate-vanishing-half","published":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 10:30:46 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Scotland","count":3,"lat":55.95438,"lng":-3.20144,"type":"country"},{"name":"Atlantic","count":1,"lat":39.36287,"lng":-74.42637,"type":"point"},{"name":"California","count":1,"lat":38.57944,"lng":-121.49085,"type":"point"},{"name":"Highlands","count":1,"lat":35.05342,"lng":-83.19668,"type":"point"},{"name":"New York","count":1,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"Louisiana","count":1,"lat":30.44335,"lng":-91.18664,"type":"point"},{"name":"Gay Edinburgh","count":1,"lat":55.95438,"lng":-3.20144,"type":"point"},{"name":"France","count":2,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"country"},{"name":"Nigeria","count":1,"lat":9.06344,"lng":7.46228,"type":"country"},{"name":"The United States","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"America","count":1,"lat":51.43739,"lng":5.98176,"type":"point"},{"name":"Mallard","count":1,"lat":42.93774,"lng":-94.68176,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"Keir Starmer: Christmas relaxation of Covid rules is Boris Johnson's 'next big mistake' – video","summary":"<p>Plans to relax Covid restrictions over Christmas are an error, says the Labour leader, as swathes of England have either entered or will enter tier 3 this week, and with mounting cases and hospitalisations.

a time in the life of a writer, director and, perhaps, a company when the days shorten, the shadows lengthen and contemplating the inevitable must begin. The guy in the cloak with the retro lawn equipment can’t be ignored any longer: Death. In Pixar’s latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/13/soul-review-pixars-rapturous-tale-of-a-jazz-nut-on-a-surreal-out-of-body-journey\">Soul</a>, mortality springs itself with supreme bad timing on protagonist Joe Gardner, a New York jazzman about to play the gig of his life when he falls down a manhole. After 2017’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a> and this year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/onward-review-pixar-conjures-big-screen-adventure-with-wizard-quest-story\">Onward</a>, this is Pixar’s third film about death in as many years.

This is the realm where nascent souls must find their spark – their animating passion in life – and are then dispatched to Earth.

Over at Netflix, Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane, representing Indian film’s modernising wing, have engineered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/24/ak-vs-ak-review-anil-kapoor-anurag-kashyap\">the sharp and knowing meta-thriller AK vs AK</a>. Here on Amazon Prime Video meanwhile, you can watch veteran comedy director David Dhawan renew his IP rights on Coolie No 1, previously a hit 1995 vehicle for the Sandwell-born funnyman Govinda. Even the latter’s most devout fans would probably concede the original left room for improvements, but that’s something Dhawan appears unfussed about. This Coolie updates a few reference points and replaces Govinda with latter-day hunk Varun Dhawan – the director’s son – then surrounds him with antiquated players and playing, part of a frenetic attempt to pretend the last 30 years never happened.</p><p>The plot – lowly railway porter (Dhawan) is hired to woo a society belle (Sara Ali Khan) as part of a conspiracy to disgrace her family – remains familiar and predictable. The most immediate contrast with the original is a result of the casting. Rather too obviously a handsome, cardio-trained leading man schlubbing down for (not many) easy laughs, Dhawan Jr bounds onscreen with boyish enthusiasm, but trails a lingering note of condescension – and Dhawan Sr was evidently too busy remembering how best to smash his supporting actors in the gonads to direct anyone. Khan, sadly, is stranded on balconies looking fetchingly concerned while the men below determine her character’s destiny. In this, Coolie 2020 really does seem so last century.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/24/coolie-no-1-review-david-dhawans-comedy-remake-is-bigger-but-not-better\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/24/coolie-no-1-review-david-dhawans-comedy-remake-is-bigger-but-not-better","published":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 18:53:50 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Ak","count":1,"lat":58.29973,"lng":-134.40679,"type":"point"},{"name":"Songbreaks","count":1,"lat":37.29401,"lng":-82.28016,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"How Canada Has Become a Pilgrimage Site for 'Schitt's Creek' Fans","summary":"The hamlet that was the backdrop for the hit television series Schitt’s Creek has become a pilgrimage site for fans, to the joy and consternation of locals.","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/world/canada/schitts-creek.html","published":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 00:04:31 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Goodwood","count":1,"lat":-33.90638,"lng":18.55145,"type":"point"},{"name":"Ontario","count":1,"lat":43.64869,"lng":-79.38544,"type":"point"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml","title":"Canada receives first shipment of Moderna COVID vaccines","summary":"Officials say Moderna vaccine will be distributed to remote, isolated communities in northern Canada.","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/24/canada-receives-first-shipment-of-moderna-covid-vaccines","published":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 21:57:23 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"Canada","count":12,"lat":45.42178,"lng":-75.69116,"type":"country"},{"name":"The United States’","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"North”","count":1,"lat":34.43734,"lng":35.84711,"type":"point"},{"name":"North","count":1,"lat":34.43734,"lng":35.84711,"type":"point"},{"name":"Ontario","count":2,"lat":43.64869,"lng":-79.38544,"type":"point"},{"name":"Quebec","count":2,"lat":46.81273,"lng":-71.2193,"type":"point"}],"source":"Aljazeera"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"Brexit Is Finally Done, but U.K. Ambitions Already Seems Outdated","summary":"The idea of an agile “Global Britain” was an effective sales pitch.

And what really belongs in the bottom drawer? Experts solve your family washing-up conflicts</p><p>If you still feel the sting of parental reprimands for barbarically stacking your plate in the dishwasher without rinsing it first, one good thing 2020 can offer is vindication. While everyone has their own methods, tricks and opinions on conventional wisdom, the misinformation around a machine that’s meant to make our lives easier has caused generations-long feuds – and water wastage.</p><p>Fact: You do not need to pre-rinse. Just scrape the solids into the bin, says Ashley Iredale, white goods expert at the independent consumer advocacy group Choice. Most dishwashers have inbuilt turbidity sensors that measure how much dirt is in the water from the first rinse cycle, so rinsed plates may fool the system. “If you pre-rinse everything, your dishwasher’s going to think that your plates are cleaner than they actually are, so it won’t wash as intensely and they might actually come out dirtier,” says Iredale.

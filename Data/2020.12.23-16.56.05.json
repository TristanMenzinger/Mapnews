There was a full month when everybody was watching it, when I desperately tried to stay part of the conversation. But I just could not invest.

I feel like the characters on that show are so strong and opinionated and have a sense of humour and self-awareness. It’s an incredible alchemy. It’s a great social group that they’ve put together to film. I was surprised to enjoy it, because I worked in reality television for a long time. I hosted the aftershow for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/08/the-hills-10-years-on-reality-tv-hollywood-towie-made-in-chelsea-kardashians\">The Hills</a> before my career started.

But does Charlie now wish he’d asked for more?</p><p>The look of panic, the embarrassed laugh, the mortified apologies: a young child crashing a work video call has been the peril of lockdown for working parents and many would have instantly recognised Deborah Haynes’s pain. The difference for the Sky News foreign affairs editor was that she was on live television, broadcasting from her spare room – and so was her four-year-old son, Charlie, who had come in to ask if he could have two biscuits. In a grim year, it was one of the lighter moments.</p><p>We speak over Zoom one morning as Haynes is trying to get everyone ready for school. Charlie, hugely angelic, sits patiently for all of 20 seconds before wandering off. That morning in July, Haynes had been asked to go on air at fairly short notice to talk about the strained relations between the UK and China over Hong Kong. Her two older children were out. “I put Charlie in front of the television and I think I gave him a cake, so I genuinely thought I was covered,” she says. “I had played out in my head what I would do if he came in and never properly established it; I just didn’t think it would really ever happen. So when it did, I genuinely wanted a hole to gobble me up. It was like everything slowed down.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/17/deborah-haynes-son-charlie-went-on-tv-to-ask-for-two-biscuits-did-he-ever-get-them\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/17/deborah-haynes-son-charlie-went-on-tv-to-ask-for-two-biscuits-did-he-ever-get-them","published":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 15:00:02 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"China","count":1,"lat":39.90657,"lng":116.38765,"type":"country"},{"name":"Hong Kong","count":1,"lat":22.2783,"lng":114.16039,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"‘Sticky Bombs’ Sow Terror and Chaos in a City on Edge","summary":"The Taliban’s recent shift to magnetic bombs to target Afghan officials in Kabul underscores the government’s struggle to protect its own people.","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/world/asia/afghanistan-magnetic-bombs.html","published":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 02:30:38 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"The United States","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Afghanistan","count":2,"lat":34.53313,"lng":69.10223,"type":"country"},{"name":"Qatar","count":1,"lat":25.29424,"lng":51.51967,"type":"country"},{"name":"Iraq","count":1,"lat":33.3421,"lng":44.39307,"type":"country"},{"name":"Kabul","count":3,"lat":34.53313,"lng":69.10223,"type":"point"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"Pop in 2020: an escape into disco, folklore and nostalgia","summary":"<p>Amid the chaos of the pandemic and with the future so uncertain, the pop music that resonated was glittery, danceable and comfortingly familiar</p><p>Pop music has the ability to be more reactive to current events than ever. Advances in technology mean that the famously swift musical responses of rock’s past – Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young’s Ohio, in the US Top 20 within weeks of the Kent State massacre that inspired it; the hastily cobbled-together tributes to Elvis Presley and John Lennon that appeared in the charts in the wake of their deaths – should theoretically look tardy.

Even the Killers reworked their 2019 anti-Trump track Land of the Free to reference Floyd’s death. But if anyone was expecting something similar to happen as a result of Covid-19 – a rash of unexpected new releases ruminating on the strangeness and anxieties of life in a pandemic or sternly admonishing politicians for their mishandling of the crisis – 2020 will have proved a crashing disappointment. They didn’t happen in any quantity, unless you count the well-intentioned but musically ghastly burst of charity singles that proliferated during the spring lockdown, or the equally abysmal anti-lockdown tracks released by Van Morrison and Ian Brown, rock’s own tinfoil-hatted Laurel and Hardy.

Children the world over are falling through the cracks, with governments ignoring child rights violations under the guise of having more urgent crises to tackle. Equally disturbing is any acceptance of this as a regrettable necessity. For activists, civil society groups and international agencies working to reverse regressive norms legitimising child labour, any message that appears to condone it in any form is dangerous.</p><p>Apologists for child labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/06/child-labour-doesnt-have-to-be-exploitation-it-gave-me-life-skills\">often argue in favour of “good” work</a> – usually done in household settings, against “bad” work – which takes place in commercial settings and is deemed exploitative and hazardous. But in reality, it is virtually impossible to draw a clear line between good and bad work. The negative impacts of child labour on physical and mental health are well documented – poor growth, malnutrition, serious skin and other infections, chronic lung disease, musculoskeletal deformities, impairments to hearing, vision and immune function, and behavioural and emotional disorders. These harms are not restricted to the most hazardous forms of child labour but can be equally true for activities undertaken within the household. Even a seemingly benign task such as cooking the family meal will expose a girl to the risks associated with indoor pollution caused by cooking fires.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/16/child-labour-is-exploitation-theres-no-such-thing-as-good-and-bad-work\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/16/child-labour-is-exploitation-theres-no-such-thing-as-good-and-bad-work","published":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:29 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Andhra Pradesh","count":1,"lat":16.50256,"lng":80.63977,"type":"point"},{"name":"India","count":1,"lat":28.63095,"lng":77.21721,"type":"country"},{"name":"Europe","count":1,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Japan","count":1,"lat":35.68408,"lng":139.80885,"type":"country"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss","title":"Carrot the deer found in Ontario with arrow sticking out of his head","summary":"<p>Wildlife photographer Lee-Anne Carver is trying to share Carrot’s plight in hopes of saving injured deer</p><p>The Canadian winter can be tough for deer, as temperatures plummet and food becomes scarce.

book in her 40s and became the biggest selling author of the past decade in any genre – The Gruffalo alone has sold 13m copies. How did this former busker make it so big?</p><p>The room where the children’s author Julia Donaldson writes – the heart of her vast picture book empire – is down a winding staircase, in the cellar of her grand white house in Steyning, West Sussex. Her desk looks out on the street at knee height. “I’m thinking of writing a book about legs,” Donaldson said, as she showed me around the house this summer. Children from the nearby school often wave in at her as they pass. Donaldson is well known in Steyning, due to her frequent signings at the local bookshop. She and her husband, Malcolm, a retired paediatrician, recently bought the local post office to save it from closure. But elsewhere she can walk the pavement without being recognised. “I got a letter the other day for Jacqueline Wilson,” Donaldson told me. “It said: ‘You’re my favourite author!’”</p><p>If you are not someone who spends much time with young children, you may only be dimly aware of Donaldson’s work – although you will probably be familiar with her most famous creation, the Gruffalo. If you have children, however, you will know her as a cultural juggernaut whose influence among children is perhaps only surpassed by the works of Disney and CBeebies. Donaldson, who is 72, has written more than <a href=\"https://www.juliadonaldson.co.uk/about.htm\" title=\"\">210 books</a>: chiefly picture books, but also poetry, plays, a 60-part phonics reading scheme and a novel for preteens. Many of them – such as Room on the Broom, The Snail and the Whale, and What the Ladybird Heard – are already considered classics. Several have been adapted into stage shows and animated BBC films (the latest, Zog &amp; the Flying Doctors, will air on Christmas Day) and spawned an ever-expanding Donaldson universe of toys, clothing and merchandise.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/17/julia-donaldson-conquered-world-one-rhyme-at-a-time-childrens-literature-gruffalo\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/17/julia-donaldson-conquered-world-one-rhyme-at-a-time-childrens-literature-gruffalo","published":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 06:00:31 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Steyning","count":2,"lat":50.88279,"lng":-0.31772,"type":"point"},{"name":"West Sussex","count":1,"lat":50.94066,"lng":-0.43348,"type":"point"},{"name":"Hampstead","count":1,"lat":45.47873,"lng":-73.63366,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"},{"name":"Hampstead Heath","count":1,"lat":27.36233,"lng":-82.45984,"type":"point"},{"name":"Paris","count":1,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"point"},{"name":"Europe","count":2,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Brighton","count":1,"lat":50.82868,"lng":-0.13437,"type":"point"},{"name":"Methuen","count":2,"lat":42.73011,"lng":-71.18368,"type":"point"},{"name":"Easterhouse","count":1,"lat":55.86659,"lng":-4.10512,"type":"point"},{"name":"Glasgow","count":1,"lat":55.85783,"lng":-4.24251,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"A talk with France's ambassador: On Biden, climate accord and restoring allies' trust","summary":"<p>The Times speaks with Philippe Etienne, France's envoy to the U.S., on Biden's promise to rejoin the five-year-old Paris Accord that Trump disavowed.</p>","link":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-12-14/a-talk-with-frances-ambassador-on-biden-climate-accord-and-restoring-allies-trust","published":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 13:56:44 -0500","geolocations":[{"name":"Paris","count":2,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"point"},{"name":"France","count":1,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"country"},{"name":"The United States","count":6,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"United States","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"U.S.","count":10,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Europe","count":1,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"Planet","count":1,"lat":44.77373,"lng":5.64697,"type":"point"}],"source":"Los Angeles Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml","title":"In the U.K., Johnson resists ‘canceling’ Christmas to stem the coronavirus.","summary":"","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/world/in-the-uk-johnson-resists-canceling-christmas-to-stem-the-coronavirus.html","published":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 11:13:29 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","count":1,"lat":38.95953,"lng":-91.92768,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"}],"source":"The New York Times"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"Yemen is collapsing.

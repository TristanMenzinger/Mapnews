He used a razor to make three incisions on the insteps of my feet, my wrists, my elbows, my forehead and on the back of my neck. As blood started to flow, the healer rubbed a concoction of herbs into the incisions and gave me a potion to drink. He took alligator pepper and rubbed it on various parts of my body. There was a rooster, into which he cast the “demon” inside me. The rooster was slaughtered and thrown into the river, supposedly taking my sexuality with it.<br /><br />In boarding school, I met a boy who I would say was my first love. We talked about everything and liked to take long walks. But he struggled. I watched him struggle to accept his sexuality. He felt there was something wrong with him but I didn’t know how to help him. For me it was different. It wasn’t just about sexuality; it was also about gender. I was born male but I have never felt like a man.<br /><br />When I was 22, in university, I met a transgender woman. She was a lot more open, more cosmopolitan, more upfront about what she wanted. I’d never met anyone like her. We had a sisterhood –– fun, graceful, pure. It was as if the scales fell from my eyes.</p><p>What part of me has been lost in the effort to make me fit a heteronormative, socially acceptable form?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/28/gender-conversion-therapy-made-me-suicidal-i-fear-for-other-young-nigerians\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/28/gender-conversion-therapy-made-me-suicidal-i-fear-for-other-young-nigerians","published":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 07:15:06 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Nigeria","count":4,"lat":9.06344,"lng":7.46228,"type":"country"},{"name":"Brazil","count":1,"lat":-15.77829,"lng":-47.92909,"type":"country"},{"name":"Ecuador","count":1,"lat":-0.20565,"lng":-78.50888,"type":"country"},{"name":"Taiwan","count":1,"lat":25.03737,"lng":121.56355,"type":"country"},{"name":"Malta","count":1,"lat":35.89353,"lng":14.5118,"type":"country"},{"name":"Germany","count":1,"lat":52.51604,"lng":13.37691,"type":"country"},{"name":"Commonwealth","count":1,"lat":45.91361,"lng":-88.25218,"type":"point"},{"name":"Ireland","count":1,"lat":53.34807,"lng":-6.24827,"type":"country"},{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Australia","count":1,"lat":-35.30654,"lng":149.12655,"type":"country"}],"source":"The Guardian"}]

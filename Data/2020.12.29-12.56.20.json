Smith was in her early 20s, working at a bookshop and living in the Chelsea Hotel with her then lover, the playwright Sam Shepard. She had attended poetry readings before, most of which put her into a deep sleep. “I wanted to do something that wasn’t boring,” she recalls. “Sam said that since I sang to myself all the time, I should try singing a song, or maybe do something with a guitar.” And so she called on the musician Lenny Kaye to provide “interpretative” noises on guitar while she half-read, half-sang her poems.</p><p>The show was an instant hit. “It seemed to make a big impression on people – which I really didn’t understand,” she says. The producer Sandy Pearlman approached her afterwards and suggested she front a rock band. She eventually took his advice, making the landmark album Horses in 1975, and an icon of American punk was born.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/29/patti-smith-new-year-piccadilly-circus-screens\">Continue reading...</a>","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/29/patti-smith-new-year-piccadilly-circus-screens","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 08:00:36 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"New York’S","count":1,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"New York","count":3,"lat":40.71455,"lng":-74.00714,"type":"point"},{"name":"London","count":1,"lat":51.50643,"lng":-0.12719,"type":"point"},{"name":"Piccadilly Circus","count":1,"lat":51.5101,"lng":-0.13444,"type":"point"},{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Peaceable Kingdom","count":1,"lat":36.84261,"lng":-77.86283,"type":"point"},{"name":"Paris","count":1,"lat":48.85717,"lng":2.3414,"type":"point"},{"name":"Sweden","count":1,"lat":59.33257,"lng":18.06683,"type":"country"},{"name":"Milan","count":1,"lat":45.46796,"lng":9.18178,"type":"point"},{"name":"Cambridge","count":1,"lat":52.20992,"lng":0.11161,"type":"point"}],"source":"The Guardian"},{"feed_name":"World - Europe","feed_url":"http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","title":"Covid in prison: 'We should be treated like humans'","summary":"Reports suggest one-in-five prisoners have tested positive for Covid in the US, and 1,700 have died.","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55430518","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:02:05 GMT","geolocations":[{"name":"Us","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Detroit","count":1,"lat":42.33168,"lng":-83.048,"type":"point"}],"source":"BBC"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml","title":"South Korea reports record COVID deaths; secures new vaccine deal","summary":"The scale of the third wave is raising concern that country&#039;s health system will be stretched beyond capacity.","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/29/south-korea-reports-record-deaths-govt-secures-new-vaccine-deal","published":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 05:23:54 +0000","geolocations":[{"name":"South Korea","count":7,"lat":37.55886,"lng":126.99989,"type":"country"},{"name":"Seoul","count":4,"lat":37.55886,"lng":126.99989,"type":"point"},{"name":"The United States","count":1,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Europe","count":1,"lat":-33.98201,"lng":18.58413,"type":"point"},{"name":"The United Kingdom","count":1,"lat":38.95953,"lng":-91.92768,"type":"point"},{"name":"Us","count":4,"lat":38.89037,"lng":-77.03196,"type":"country"},{"name":"Pyeongtaek, South Korea","count":1,"lat":36.99136,"lng":127.08255,"type":"point"},{"name":"Spc","count":1,"lat":44.24669,"lng":-69.74068,"type":"point"}],"source":"Aljazeera"},{"feed_name":"World","feed_url":"https://www.latimes.com/world/rss2.0.xml","title":"Can COVID-19 vaccines get us to herd immunity?

He used a razor to make three incisions on the insteps of my feet, my wrists, my elbows, my forehead and on the back of my neck. As blood started to flow, the healer rubbed a concoction of herbs into the incisions and gave me a potion to drink. He took alligator pepper and rubbed it on various parts of my body. There was a rooster, into which he cast the “demon” inside me. The rooster was slaughtered and thrown into the river, supposedly taking my sexuality with it.<br /><br />In boarding school, I met a boy who I would say was my first love. We talked about everything and liked to take long walks. But he struggled. I watched him struggle to accept his sexuality. He felt there was something wrong with him but I didn’t know how to help him. For me it was different. It wasn’t just about sexuality; it was also about gender. I was born male but I have never felt like a man.<br /><br />When I was 22, in university, I met a transgender woman. She was a lot more open, more cosmopolitan, more upfront about what she wanted.
